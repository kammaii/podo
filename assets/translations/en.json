  "premium6": "Ellen, a 24-year-old living in Germany, also couldn't speak any Korean at all. She started learning Hangul with me and took 44 hours of lessons over 12 months. After that, she was able to discuss social issues in Korean while reading the news with me.",
  "premium7": "The two students were not only smart but also had a habit of being consistent. Even on busy days, they studied for at least 5 minutes every day. \nTherefore, I think I can answer this question like this:",

  "aboutDanny2": "I couldn't trust language apps anymore.",
